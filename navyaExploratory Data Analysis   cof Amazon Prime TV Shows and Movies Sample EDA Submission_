With the increasing competition in the streaming industry, platforms are continuously expanding their content offerings to attract and retain subscribers. Amazon Prime Video, as one of the leading streaming services, provides a diverse collection of content across various genres, regions, and time periods. Analyzing this data helps reveal patterns related to content strategy, audience preferences, and production trends.\n","\n","The analysis is based on two datasets in CSV format. The first dataset contains information on 9,871 titles available on Amazon Prime Video, including attributes such as content type, release year, genres, runtime, age certification, production countries, IMDb and TMDb ratings, popularity scores, and season counts for TV shows. The second dataset includes 124,235 records related to cast and crew involvement, detailing the actors and directors associated with each title. Together, these datasets provide a comprehensive view of the platform’s content and creative contributors.\n","\n","Python libraries such as Pandas and NumPy are used for data cleaning, preprocessing, and analysis, while Matplotlib and Seaborn are employed for data visualization. The project explores key aspects including the distribution of movies and TV shows, genre frequency, trends in content releases over time, and relationships between ratings and popularity. The insights derived from this analysis can support data-driven decision-making for content planning, marketing strategies, and business growth.
